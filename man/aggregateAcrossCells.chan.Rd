\title{Aggregate expression across cells}
\usage{
aggregateAcrossCells.chan(x, factors, num.threads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of matrix data like that produced by \code{\link{initializeSparseMatrix}}.
Expression values are typically expected to be counts.}

\item{factors}{A list or data frame containing one or more grouping factors.
Each entry should be a factor of the same length as the number of cells in \code{x}.}

\item{num.threads}{Integer specifying the number of threads to be used for aggregation.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{sums}, a numeric matrix where each row corresponds to a gene and each column corresponds to a unique combination of grouping levels.
Each entry contains the summed expression across all cells with that combination. 
\item \code{detected}, an integer matrix where each row corresponds to a gene and each column corresponds to a unique combination of grouping levels.
Each entry contains the number of cells with detected expression in that combination.
\item \code{combinations}, a data frame describing the levels for each unique combination.
Rows of this data frame correspond to columns of \code{sums} and \code{detected},
while columns correspond to the factors in \code{factors}.
\item \code{counts}, the number of cells associated with each combination.
Each entry corresponds to a row of \code{combinations}.
\item \code{index}, an integer vector of length equal to the number of cells in \code{x}.
This specifies the combination in \code{combinations} to which each cell was assigned.
}
}
\description{
Aggregate expression values across cells based on one or more grouping factors.
This is primarily used to create pseudo-bulk profiles for each cluster/sample combination.
}
\examples{
# Mocking a matrix:
library(Matrix)
x <- round(abs(rsparsematrix(1000, 100, 0.1) * 100))
y <- initializeSparseMatrix(x)

# Simple aggregation:
clusters <- sample(LETTERS, 100, replace=TRUE)
agg <- aggregateAcrossCells.chan(y, list(cluster=clusters))
str(agg)

# Multi-factor aggregation
samples <- sample(1:5, 100, replace=TRUE)
agg2 <- aggregateAcrossCells.chan(y, list(cluster=clusters, sample=samples))
str(agg2)
